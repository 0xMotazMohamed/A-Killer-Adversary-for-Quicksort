## A-Killer-Adversary-for-Quicksort
This project implements a research paper that demonstrates how carefully constructed adversarial input can lead to worst-case performance in Java's Arrays.sort(), which uses a dual-pivot Quicksort algorithm. The project highlights how poor pivot selection can cause time complexity to degrade from its optimal case, illustrating the need for smarter pivot strategies. By generating these worst-case inputs, the implementation provides insights into how even highly optimized algorithms can fail under specific conditions, emphasizing the importance of robust algorithm design.
